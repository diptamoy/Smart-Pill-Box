# Smart-Pill-Box
Untimed ABSTRACT medicine administration can always show adverse effects on the health of the patients. The proposed system is designed to help these patients to take the required medicine in the right proportion at the right time. The basic ideology is integrating the principle of Alarm clock with Light based slot sensing on a normal pill box. An alternate to the light based sensing method using capacitive fields is also employed. To make it more state-of-the-art, it has a web interface on which someone can give inputs about medicine and proper time as prescrited. And someone can track the whole system through the smartphones and can be notified as the input has given.
